This is a simulation of a Melander-Zabuski-McWilliams elliptical
vortex (smooth top hat profile) as described in my paper with Platte
and Mitchell.

The nice thing about it is that it emits filaments.

This is not exactly the same calculation as in the paper for two
reasons.  First, the newest release of BlobFlow uses a single-step
time integrator and the calculation in the paper uses a multistep time
integrator.  Second, the newest release uses a reverse heat equation
algorithm that is incorporated into BlobFlow whereas I was working
with prototype for the simulation in the paper.  For the paper, I had
to stop the code and do the remeshing with routines written in matlab.
However, the solutions should be very close as both are resolved to a
fine tolerance.
