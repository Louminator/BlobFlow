This is a simulation of a Melander-Zabuski-McWilliams elliptical
vortex (smooth top hat profile) as described in my paper with Platte
and Mitchell.

The nice thing about it is that it emits filaments.

This is not exactly the same calculation as in the paper because this
is designed for the new single step algorithm, and it uses the
integrated RHE interpolation subroutines.  For the paper, I had to
stop the code and do the remeshing with routines written in matlab.
However, the solutions should be the same within the error tolerance
of the new time-stepper.
