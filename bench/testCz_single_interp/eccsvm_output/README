This is output from the testCz Lamb dipole simulation.  The initial
conditions are produced using exact desingularization of an initial Gaussian.
You can project the particle positions on a regular mesh egrid -q
test0000 egrid -q test0005 etc

To compare the computation to the exact solution using matlab, use the errpic script

matlab
errpic('test',0,0)
errpic('test',5,5e-5)
etc
