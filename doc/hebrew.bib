  abstract = {The authors present a detailed study of the emergence and the long-time
	behaviour of coherent vortices in two-dimensional decaying turbulence.
	By high-resolution numerical experiments they find that the coherent
	structures are self-similar, i.e. their energy, enstrophy and size
	satisfy scaling laws. Moreover, the knowledge of the statistical
	distribution of the size of these vortices is sufficient to compute
	the energy spectrum of the 2D turbulent flow and to explain the significant
	deviations from the Kraichnan-Batchelor theory. At long times the
	motion of the fluid is dominated by the vortex dynamics, which is
	strikingly similar to the Hamiltonian motion of few point vortices,
	as is confirmed by a comparison between the numerical simulations
	of the two systems. }

  abstract = {Ellipsoidal functions and ellipsoidal co-ordinates, naturally adapted
	to the treatment of potential problems involving ellipsoidal boundaries,
	are due to a relatively complicated mathematical appearance avoided
	in the majority of textbooks on electromagnetism, leading to an unjustified
	ignorance of the whole system. The paper at hand is devoted to showing
	that the system is worthwhile using and investigating. By first recollecting
	the key results of the co-ordinate system and the related potential
	functions, including the indispensable orthogonality result and the
	reciprocal distance formula, basic potential problems of electrostatics
	are reviewed. Closed-form expressions are thereupon derived for the
	induced charge and its centroid in the case of a point charge influencing
	a grounded ellipsoid. An image source interpretation, generalising
	the image solution for a sphere, follows easily from these expressions,
	as well as an approximate expression for the mutual capacitance between
	two ellipsoids or a parallel disk capacitor. An expression is also
	given for the total polarisation induced in a dielectric ellipsoid
	by the influence of a point dipole.},
